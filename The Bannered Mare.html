<i>Stories are for children and dreamers.<br>
Poetry is for weaklings and madmen.<br>
Epics glorify the vile and vilify the glorious.<br>
Read minds, not words.<br></i>

The Elder Scrolls games have quite a lot of books describing much of the history of Tamriel outside of the games themselves, so if anyone would want to read lore, here are some sites that have most information on them.<br>
<br>
<a href="http://elderlore.wordpress.com/">Elder Lore</a><br>
Blog from a lad that talks about lore through podcasts, very interesting if you take the time.<br>
<br>
<a href="http://imperial-library.info/">The Imperial Library</a><br>
Website that has most if not all books from the Elder Scrolls universe available for reading (with the exception of those that need to be bought).<br>
<br>
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=sr_nr_scat_283155_ln?rh=n%3A283155%2Ck%3Aelder+scrolls&keywords=elder+scrolls&ie=UTF8&qid=1361886435&scn=283155&h=538fcf5629aa8e26514b779e5ab887888e0457f0">Official Books</a><br>
