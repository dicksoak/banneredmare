<i>Stories are for children and dreamers.<br>
Poetry is for weaklings and madmen.<br>
Epics glorify the vile and vilify the glorious.<br>
Read minds, not words.<br></i>

<font size="4"><b>Lore</b></font size><br>
There are quite a lot of books describing much of the history of Tamriel from the Elder Scrolls games, aside the games themselves. If anyone would want to read lore, here are some sites that will supply you.<br>
<br>
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0345508017">The Infernal City</a><br>
A book by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gregory_Keyes">Gregory Keyes</a>, this novel is set four decades after the Oblivion Crisis.<br>
<br>
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0345508025">Lord of Souls</a><br>
Written by the same author as The Infernal City, Gregory Keyes, this book builds upon The Infernal City, as Prince Attrebus sets out to find Umbra, the sword that will supposedly save Tamriel.<br>
